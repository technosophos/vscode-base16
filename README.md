# Base16 Theme Pack

Because what you really need is 134 hacker-oriented colorschmes from which to choose.

[Base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/) is a set of colorschemes that can be shared across multiple tools, from VIM and Emacs to your command prompt or shell.

This extension contains all 134 of the base16 themes. It provides VS Code wrappers for the [TextMate version](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-textmate) of the Base16 themes.

## Customizing (Disabling Themes)

Yes, 134 can be a lot. As far as I know, the only way to disable a theme is to edit this theme's `package.json` and remove the themes you do not like. If you know of a better way, please let me know.
