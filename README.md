# Base16 Theme Pack

Because what you really need is 60+ hacker-oriented colorschmes from which to choose.

[Base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/) is a set of colorschemes that can be shared across multiple tools, from VIM and Emacs to your command prompt or shell.

This extension contains 60+ of the base16 themes. It provides VS Code wrappers for the [TextMate version](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-textmate) of the Base16 themes.

## Customizing (Disabling Themes)

Yes, 60 can be a lot. As far as I know, the only way to disable a theme is to edit this theme's `package.json` and remove the themes you do not like. If you know of a better way, please let me know.
